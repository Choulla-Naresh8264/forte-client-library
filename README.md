This client library does not have any external dependencies.

To run the unit tests locally you will need composer installed.  You also need phpunit installed.  Then you need to generate the autload file so that the classes will be imported into the test scripts.  If you already have phpunit installed then you can just run `composer dump-autoload` from the base directory of this repo.  You can install phpunit and generate the autoload file by running `composer install` from the base directory of this repo.
